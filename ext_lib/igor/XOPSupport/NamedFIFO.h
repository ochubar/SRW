/***	The data structures here are the same as those used internally by**	Igor Pro.  Unlike wave handles you deal with these structures directly.**	Thus you have to be careful to verify version numbers**	before using.**	NOTE:**		as of 8-17-94, this structure def was changed to be ansii compliant.**		Previously, the fifoData item at the end of the struct was a [0]**		and is now a [1]. We still think of it as [0] and use the follow**		to determine the base size:**			ZSIZEOF(NamedFIFO,fifoData)**		where ZSIZEOF is defined like so:**			#define ZSIZEOF(x,y) ((size_t)&( (x *) 0)->y)****	Note:**		MAX_OBJ_NAME= 31**		number types below are described in help for WaveType**	LH951230: Made sneaky change to struct ChartChanInfo. First element**		was a long and is now two shorts. Old code should contine to work**		without change.****	JW980205: Made another sneaky change. In NamedFIFO structure, shortened**		the fifoVersion field to unsigned char in order to use the high byte**		for bitwise flags. So far, only one bit is used: bit 0 on means that**		bytes must be swapped when reading the FIFO's file. An XOP that gets**		this new version won't be affected as long as it either only writes**		to FIFO files, or if it only works with FIFO's written on the same platform.**		An XOP that really needs to handle cross-platform FIFO's must be re-written**		to use the new field.*/#include "XOPStructureAlignmentTwoByte.h"	// All structures passed to Igor are two-byte aligned.#define FIFO_VERSION_NUM 0x03#define FIFO_SWAP_BYTES 1		// for use in the flags fieldtypedef struct NamedFIFO{	struct NamedFIFO **next;	// linked list of these thingies	char name[MAX_OBJ_NAME+1];	// name of this fifo		long fifoTot;				// total chunks written to fifo so far	long diskTot;				// total chunks written to disk so far	long fifoSize;				// size of FIFO in chunks		long fifoWrite;				// byte offset into fifo data for next write	long diskRead;				// byte offset into fifo data for next disk read	long fifoBytes;				// size of FIFO in bytes		short frefnum;				// refnum of open file or zero	unsigned char flags;		// for up to 8 flags... 980205: bit 0 on indicates that bytes must be swapped when reading from the FIFO's data	unsigned char fifoVersion;	// version number of this data structure		short running;				// non-zero if in running state	short valid;				// set true when everything is jake; false when not	short fileDataStart;		// position in disk file of start of data area	short error;				// error number for runtime error.
